# Computable

Any problem that can be solved by an algorithm are computable. 

# P Problems

Polynomial time: relatively easy to solve in computers 
Examples: Shortest path, sorting names, finding items on list. 
Polynomial: $f(n)=n^a$
This follows the [[Multiplication rule]]

# NP Problems

**Unique feature:** if given the solution it turns out to be easy to verify it is correct in polynomial time **and** hard to solve but easy to check, like a sudoku. Their complexity increases exponentially as their input increases, multiple sudokus. 
Exponential: $f(n)=2^n$

# P = NP?

Mathematicians came with Polynomial algorithms for easy NP problems, and thus they thought that P = NP. 

# NP Complete

All hard problems in NP are actually equivalent, if you proof that one is equal to P, then all are equal to P.
