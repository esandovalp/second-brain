2. Having a growth mindset: improving themselves, learning. 
3. Perceived partner commitment: how they think their partner is.

5. Sexual satisfaction 
6. Perceived partner satisfaction: how happy the partner is 
7. Conflict: how much or how little conflict is in the relationships.

The characteristics of the relationship themselves matters the most. It is the relationship that we build, the dynamic. 
Shared experiences, internal jokes, etc.
