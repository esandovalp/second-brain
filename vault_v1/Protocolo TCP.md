> Transmission Control Protocol
- **Core Internet Standard:** TCP is a fundamental protocol within the Internet protocol suite, often referenced as TCP/IP. It works in tandem with the Internet Protocol (IP).
- **Role:** TCP is responsible for the reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on networked computers.
- **Connection-Oriented:** Before data exchange begins, TCP establishes a connection between the sender and receiver. Think of it like a dedicated phone line for communication.
