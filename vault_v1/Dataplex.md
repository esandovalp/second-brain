## What is Dataplex?

- **Intelligent Data Fabric:** Dataplex is a Google Cloud service that helps you organize, manage, and understand your data that's spread across different parts of your cloud environment (data lakes, data warehouses, etc.). It gives you a centralized view and control over your data.    
- **Simplified Management:** Dataplex can make it easier to manage data in big organizations with lots of siloed data:
    - **Discovery:** Find and catalog data from different sources (including metadata like what the data means).
    - **Security:** Create unified policies to control who can access data, keeping it secure.
    - **Governance:** Track how data is used and changes (good for compliance or managing quality).
- **Not a Replacement:** Dataplex doesn't store the data itself; it focuses on managing the metadata (information about your data) and making sure all the bits and pieces work together nicely.

## Why Use Dataplex?

2. **Breaking Down Silos:** Companies often have data scattered across multiple cloud stores, making it hard to use. Dataplex provides a bridge between those silos.
    
4. **Centralized Control:** With Dataplex, you can set common security rules and enforce consistent data governance practices across a variety of locations where your data might live.
    
6. **Easier Analytics & AI:** When your data is cataloged, governed, and findable, it's much easier for analysts to gain insights and for data scientists to find the right data to train their machine learning models.
    
8. **Data Fabric Concept:** Dataplex fits into the concept of a "data fabric", which is a way to treat your data as a connected resource regardless of where it is physically stored.
    

**Key Components**

- **Lakes:** A concept within Dataplex to represent a logical data domain (similar to a department: Finance Lake, Marketing Lake, etc.).
- **Zones:** Within lakes, zones help you further subdivide and organize your data assets.
- **Assets:** Individual datasets represented in Dataplex (could be BigQuery tables, Cloud Storage buckets, etc.).

## Why use it?

It is a [[data mesh]] that also includes data cataloging capability with Data Catalog. Consumers of data can search and discover information readily without 
having to wait for data producers to respond, which reduces the bottlenecks on data analysis.
