Neural Network:
- Neuron: a thing that holds a number. Is its activated when the number it holds is high $[0,1]$. The number depends on the input, that means it's a function. 
- Network: connections or edges between nodes $w_i$. 
$\sigma (w_1a_1+w_2a_2+...+w_na_n+b)$
Multilayer perceptron: old stuff
Learning: finding the rights weights and biases.
