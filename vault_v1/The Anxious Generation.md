By [[Jonathan Haidt]]

When the iPhone came (and similar technologies with it) a lot of parents were relieved to find their children using this technologies and being quiet. We've learned that the companies that developed this technologies had made no research in the effects of the mental health of their customers. 
Haidt makes the relation between these developers and the companies leading the tobacco and vaping industry, specially the ones that design their product to be highly addictive, that just sound insane. Taking into account the fact that social media is actually quite helpful. The thing is, the adults making this products know that if the adult consumer becomes addicted to their product, it's up to them, but they did not take into account what happens when a child becomes addicted to it. The author names my generation "The Anxious Generation".

My generation became the first to "... devote a large part of their consciousness--perpetually--to managing what became their online brand." We are the first generation that have developed the first mental disorders, that as today, have no name. All thanks to the internet.
His central claim is that overprotection in the real world and underprotection in the virtual world are the major reasons why Gen Z became the anxious generation.

I have often found that a lot of relationships created on my teens were a consequence of the virtual world. There was a low bar for both entry and exit. A lot of people just wanted to hangout with other because they had a lot of followers on instagram, or because they knew someone that was an influencer.
As an adult I still see this trend, and now see the consequences of it. A lot of my peers in collage, and myself included, found it hard to make new friends, and specially, keep them. A big reason of this was because the first time we met each other was happening in the pandemic, were our only ways of communicating, most of the time, was via text messages. 

Data has shown that the people that spend the most time on social media are more depressed than those who do not, [[Twenge and Campbell]]
