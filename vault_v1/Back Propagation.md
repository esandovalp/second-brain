> How a single training example would like to nudge the weights and biases. 

Core method to how neural networks work.
Telling the network in the second to last layer how much you want to nudge each neuron (**desired changes**) to a direction in order to output what you want, and go all the way back. It is loosely put, the number in the **negative gradient of the cost fuction.**
