The point of the book is to take a broader view of what AI is. AI is whatever it cost: natural resources, fuel, human labor, infrastructures, logistics, histories, and classifications. She politicizes AI. She explores the economic, political, cultural, and historical forces that shape AI.

We understand why AI is political when we start asking the right questions, like *what* is being optimized, *for whom,* and *who* gets to decide.

The book is a change in perspective in AI, seeing it as an extractive industry.

# Labor 

We're introduced with the workflow at Amazon, she tells us about the Machine Learning algorithm that, if a package gets broken, automatically knows what to do next. 
The question is not whether robots will replace humans, but if humans will increasingly be treated as robots, by the increase in surveillance, algorithmic assessment, and the modulation of time. 

Large scale computation is deeply rooted in and running on the exploitation of human bodies.
The encroachment of AI into the workplace should properly be understood as a return to older practices of industrial labor exploitation that were well established in the 1890s and the early twentieth century. The main difference is that employers now observe, assess, and modulate intimate parts of the work cycle and bodily data that were perviously off-limits to them.
Work ceased to be primarily a product of human labor and took on an increasingly machinelike character, **with workers adapting to the needs of the machine and its particular rhythms and cadences.** Marx: workers as "an appendage of the machine".

The surveillance systems trace back to the 1780s, where Samuel Bentham developed the inspection house--which later became the panopticon. 
	*"Also, since Michel Foucault's Discipline and Punish, it has become commonplace to consider the prison as the origin point of today's **surveillance society**, with the elder Bentham as is ideological progenitor. In fact, the panoptic prison owes its origins to the work of the younger Bentham in the context of the early manufacturing facility. The panopticon began as a workplace mechanism well before it was conceptualized for prisons."* 
Now, "as workplace AI becomes more prevalent, many of the more basic monitoring and tracking systems are being expanded with new predictive capacities to become increasingly invasive mechanisms of worker management, asset control, and value extraction".
Clients treat human employees as little more than machines, because to recognize their work and compensate it fairly would make AI more expensive and less "efficient."

## Potemkin AI 

“Much like Potemkin’s decorated villages and model workshops, many valuable automated systems feature a combination of underpaid digital pieceworkers and consumers taking on unpaid tasks to make systems function. Meanwhile, companies seek to convince investors and the general public that intelligent machines are doing the work.”
“Mechanical Turk is a massively distributed workshop where humans emulate and improve on AI systems by checking and correcting algorithmic processes. This is what Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos brazenly calls “artificial artificial intelligence.”

“Contemporary forms of artificial intelligence are neither artificial nor intelligent. We can—and should—speak instead of the hard physical labor of mine workers, the repetitive factory labor on the assembly line, the cybernetic labor in the cognitive sweatshops of outsourced programmers, the poorly paid crowdsourced labor of Mechanical Turk workers, and the unpaid immaterial work of everyday users.”
## Visions of Disassembly and Workplace Automation: Babbage, Ford, and Taylor 

Babbage: “Through a combination of computation, surveillance, and labor discipline, he argued, it would be possible to enforce ever-higher degrees of efficiency and quality control.”
For Babbage value came from the logistical process, not by the work itself. The workforce is a source of trouble, and not a source of value.
“As companies reap the benefits of increasing automation, people are, on average, working longer hours, in more jobs, for less pay, in insecure positions."

### The meat market

“The persistence of this pattern underscores how power responds to critique: whether the product is cow carcasses or facial recognition, the response is to accept regulation at the margins but to leave untouched the underlying logics of production.”
“Foxconn, the largest electronics manufacturing company in the world, which makes Apple iPhones and iPads, is a vivid example of how workers are reduced to animal bodies performing tightly controlled tasks. Foxconn became notorious for its rigid and militaristic management protocols after a spate of suicides in 2010.44 Just two years later, the company’s chairman, Terry Gou, described his more than one million employees this way: “As human beings are also animals, to manage one million animals gives me a headache.”

In short, labour in the time of AI is reduced to optimizing surveillance, standardization, and the reduction of individual craft. 
### Private time

“Other forms of insurgence have centered on adding friction to the work process. The French anarchist Émile Pouget used the term “sabotage” to mean the equivalent of a “go slow” on the factory floor, when workers intentionally reduce their pace of work.67 The objective was to withdraw efficiency, to reduce the value of time as a currency. Although there will always be ways to resist the imposed temporality of work, with forms of algorithmic and video monitoring, this becomes much harder—as the relation between work and time is observed at ever closer range.”
Defining time is an established strategy for centralizing power.

### Setting the rate

"...building a movement across different factories and sectors of Amazon’s workforce to address the core issues of power and centralization represented by the relentless rhythm of “the rate” itself.”

“All kinds of workers are subject to the extractive technical infrastructures that seek to control and analyze time to its finest grain—many of whom have no identification with the technology sector or tech work at all”
