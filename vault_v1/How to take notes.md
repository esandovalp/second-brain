**Ultimate goal**: get the quickest access to the most information possible and task one of that was figuring out how we can help ourselves remember stuff better.
- We tend to remember concepts that we think about often and which are linked to lots of other concepts conceptual note-taking encourages this by promoting active learning during a lecture making use of your old notes and linking things in a way that makes sense to you not which necessarily makes sense to the professor with 
#### Sequential Notes 
- Sequential notes you're wasting time copying down information when you could be learning it you're forcing your mind to adapt to the way the teacher presents the information and you're focusing on the same connections as everybody else in the world which is the fastest way to never have an original thought and by not keeping your old notes relevant you're throwing away years of your life that you spent learning the fundamentals 
- You're making it harder to learn new stuff and you're building a skyscraper of knowledge on a foundation of toothpicks which is the polar opposite of first principles thinking and you got to retake notes on the ideal gas law every single time because nobody can remember that thing.
#### Atomic Notes 
For the stuff you can't remember or at least can't memorize right now making [[Atomic Notes]] on your computer provides all the information you've ever learned in an easy to understand format that is literally just a search away. It doesn't get much faster than that for your second brain.
#### Generalize Knowledge into Concepts
In life the goal is not to learn as much as possible, the goal is to do as much as possible instead of doing things into the context in which you originally learned them. 
If you generalize your knowledge into concepts then the rate at which you can learn to do things takes off much faster than the rate at which you can come to know things.
