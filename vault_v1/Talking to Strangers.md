#book by Malcom Gladwell (writer of Outliers)
# Introducción

Durante la historia, los conflictos raramente han sido entre extraños (strangers). La gran excepción a esto ha sido la conquista española, pero incluso en este caso los tlaxcaltecas atacaron a sus vecinos. El mundo es como esa interacción, entre Cortés y Moctezuma tratando de entenderse a pesar de tener una historia completamente diferente. Es por esto que escribió el libro, del porque somos tan malos en el acto de traducción. Cada capítulo tocara un elemento de porque. 

# Part One. Spies and Diplomats: Two Puzzles

## Chapter One. Fidel Castro Revenge

Florentino Aspillaga quería salir de Cuba con una bombota, así que se fue a Estados Unidos a decirles a los gringos los nombres de las personas que el conocía, y resultó que todas esas personas eran doble agentes de la CIA, sin embargo, estaban dando información falsa a los gringos, cosa que Fidel Castro dirigió, y finalmente lanzó un documental en el que se burlan de los agentes de la CIA.

Puzzle Number One: Why can’t we tell when the stranger in front of us is lying to our face?:

## Chapter Two. Getting to Know der Führer

Neville Chamberlain quería conocer a Hitler en 1938, ya que ningún alto oficial de los aliados lo había conocido. Cuando lo conoció pensó que no quería ir a una guerra. En general todos los que estuvieron con Hitler pensaron que no quería ir a una guerra, evidentemente estaban mal, y todos los que no lo conocieron pensaban lo correcto. Todos creemos entender a alguien cuando los vemos a los ojos y juzgamos, pero Chamberlain y Halafax hicieron eso con Hitler y salieron con una impresión completamente errónea. 

Puzzle Number Two: How is it that meeting a stranger can sometimes make us worse at making sense of that person than not meeting them?

“We have, in other words, CIA officers who cannot make sense of their spies, judges who cannot make sense of their defendants, and prime ministers who cannot make sense of their adversaries. We have people struggling with their first impressions of a stranger. We have people struggling when they have months to understand a stranger. We have people struggling when they meet with someone only once, and people struggling when they return to the stranger again and again. They struggle with assessing a stranger’s honesty. They struggle with a stranger’s character. They struggle with a stranger’s intent. It’s a mess.”

Los desconocidos (strangers) no son fáciles. 

# Part Two. Default to Truth

## Chapter Three. The Queen of Cuba 

“The issue with spies is not that there is something brilliant about them. It is that there is something wrong with us."

Somos pésimos detectando mentiras porque: “We do not behave, in other words, like sober-minded scientists, slowly gathering evidence of the truth or falsity of something before reaching a conclusion. We do the opposite. We start by believing. And we stop believing only when our doubts and misgivings rise to the point where we can no longer explain them away.”

We default to truth.

Le crees a alguien porque no tienes las suficientes dudas sobre ellos. 

## Chapter Four. The Holy Fool 

“Tim Levine reminds us, lies are rare. And those lies that are told are told by a very small subset of people. That’s why it doesn’t matter so much that we are terrible at detecting lies in real life. Under the circumstances, in fact, defaulting to truth makes logical sense. If the person behind the counter at the coffee shop says your total with tax is $6.74, you can do the math yourself to double-check their calculations, holding up the line and wasting thirty seconds of your time. Or you can simply assume the salesperson is telling you the truth, because on balance most people do tell the truth.”

## Chapter Five. The Boy in the Shower

“...doubts are not the enemy of belief; they are its companion.”

“Default to truth becomes an issue when we are forced to choose between two alternatives, one of which is likely and the other of which is impossible to imagine”

“Default to truth biases us in favor of the most likely interpretation.”

“We think we want our guardians to be alert to every suspicion. We blame them when they default to truth. When we try to send people like Graham Spanier to jail, we send a message to all of those in positions of authority about the way we want them to make sense of strangers—without stopping to consider the consequences of sending that message.”

# Part Three: Transparency

## Chapter Three. The Friends Fallacy

“Transparency is the idea that people’s behavior and demeanor—the way they represent themselves on the outside—provides an authentic and reliable window into the way they feel on the inside. It is the second of the crucial tools we use to make sense of strangers. When we don’t know someone, or can’t communicate with them, or don’t have the time to understand them properly, we believe we can make sense of them through their behavior and demeanor.”

“Transparency is the idea that people’s behavior and demeanor—the way they represent themselves on the outside—provides an authentic and reliable window into the way they feel on the inside. It is the second of the crucial tools we use to make sense of strangers. When we don’t know someone, or can’t communicate with them, or don’t have the time to understand them properly, we believe we can make sense of them through their behavior and demeanor.”

“If real life were like Friends, judges would beat computers. But they don’t. So maybe real life isn’t like Friends.”

“I don’t think that this mistake—expecting what is happening on the outside to perfectly match what is going on inside—matters with our friends. Part of what it means to get to know someone is to come to understand how idiosyncratic their emotional expressions can be”

“This is the explanation for the second of the puzzles, in Chapter Two, about why computers do a much better job than judges at making bail decisions. The computer can’t see the defendant. Judges can, and it seems logical that that extra bit of information ought to make them better decision-makers”

“Some years ago there was a famous case in Texas in which a young man named Patrick Dale Walker put a gun to his ex-girlfriend’s head—only to have the gun jam as he pulled the trigger. The judge in his case set bail at $1 million, then lowered it to $25,000 after Walker had spent four days in jail, on the grounds that this was long enough for him to “cool off.” Walker, the judge explained later, had nothing on his record, “not even a traffic ticket.” He was polite: “He was a real low-key, mild-mannered young man. The kid, from what I understand, is a real smart kid. He was valedictorian of his class. He graduated from college. This was supposedly his first girlfriend.” Most important, according to the judge, Walker showed remorse.         
The judge thought Walker was transparent. But what does “showed remorse” mean? Did he put on a sad face, cast his eyes down, and lower his head, the way he had seen people show remorse on a thousand television shows? And why do we think that if someone puts on a sad face, casts their eyes down, and lowers their head, then some kind of sea change has taken place in their heart? Life is not like Friends. Seeing Walker didn't help the judge. It hurt him. It allowed him to explain away the simple fact that Walker had put a gun to his girlfriend's head and failed to killed her only because the gun misfired. Four months later, while out on bail, Walker shot his girlfriend to death.”

## Chapter Seven. A Short of Explanation of Amanda Knox Case

“ We think liars in real life behave like liars would on Friends—telegraphing their internal states with squirming and darting eyes. This is—to put it mildly—nonsense. Liars don’t look away”

“When a liar acts like an honest person, though, or when an honest person acts like a liar, we’re flummoxed. Nervous Nelly is mismatched. She looks like she’s lying, but she’s not. She’s just nervous! In other words, human beings are not bad lie detectors. We are bad lie detectors in those situations when the person we’re judging is mismatched.”

**Knox:** “I think everyone’s reaction to something horrible is different."  
	Todas las personas tienen reacciones diferentes a cualquier tipo de escenario, y la gente debería saber que no tienes que comportarte de la manera que ellos esperan. 

## Chapter Eight. Case Study: The Fraternity Party

“Under the best of circumstances, lack of transparency makes the encounter between a man and a woman at a party a problematic event. So what happens when alcohol is added to the mix?”

“The myopia theory was first suggested by psychologists Claude Steele and Robert Josephs. Alcohol makes the thing in the foreground even more salient and the thing in the background less significant. It makes short-term considerations loom large, and more cognitively demanding, longer-term considerations fade away.”

“Drinking puts you at the mercy of your environment. It crowds out everything except the most immediate experiences.”

“Consent is something that two parties negotiate, on the assumption that each side in a negotiation is who they say they are. But how can you determine consent when, at the moment of negotiation, both parties are so far from their true selves?”

“The outcome of People v. Brock Turner brought a measure of justice to Emily Doe. But so long as we refuse to acknowledge what alcohol does to the interaction between strangers, that evening at Kappa Alpha will be repeated again. And again.”

# Part Four: Lessons

## Chapter Nine. KSM: What Happens When the Stranger is a Terrorist? 

**Summary (UTTP):** “Default to truth is a crucially important strategy that occasionally and unavoidably leads us astray. Transparency is a seemingly commonsense assumption that turns out to be an illusion. Both, however, raise the same question: once we accept our shortcomings, what should we do?”

“Whatever it is we are trying to find out about the strangers in our midst is not robust. The “truth” about Amanda Knox or Jerry Sandusky or KSM is not some hard and shiny object that can be extracted if only we dig deep enough and look hard enough. The thing we want to learn about a stranger is fragile. If we tread carelessly, it will crumple under our feet. And from that follows a second cautionary note: we need to accept that the search to understand a stranger has real limits. We will never know the whole truth. We have to be satisfied with something short of that. The right way to talk to strangers is with caution and humility. How many of the crises and controversies I have described would have been prevented had we taken those lessons to heart?”

# Part Five: Coupling 

## Chapter Ten: Sylvia Plath 

Alfred Alvarez about Sylvia Plath: “For the unhappy,” Alvarez wrote, “Christmas is always a bad time: the terrible false jollity that comes at you from every side, braying about goodwill and peace and family fun, makes loneliness and depression particularly hard to bear. I had never seen her so strained.”

“Poets die young. That is not just a cliché. The life expectancy of poets, as a group, trails playwrights, novelists, and nonfiction writers by a considerable margin. They have higher rates of “emotional disorders” than actors, musicians, composers, and novelists. And of every occupational category, poets have far and away the highest suicide rates—as much as five times higher than the general population. Something about writing poetry appears either to attract the wounded or to open new wounds—and few have so perfectly embodied that image of the doomed genius as Sylvia Plath."
1. “A poet has to adapt himself, more or less consciously, to the demands of his vocation,” Stephen Spender, himself an accomplished poet, once wrote, “and hence the peculiarities of poets and the condition of inspiration which many people have said is near to madness.”

Coupling is the idea that behaviors are linked to very specific circumstances and conditions. If suicide is coupled, then it isn’t simply the act of depressed people. It’s the act of depressed people at a particular moment of extreme vulnerability and in combination with a particular, readily available lethal means. If suicide is coupled, on the other hand, then it should vary with the availability of particular methods of committing suicide. When a new and easy method such as town gas arrives on the scene, suicides should rise; when that method is taken away, they should fall. The suicide curve should look like a roller coaster.
3. “I haven’t even mentioned the biggest example of how our inability to understand suicide costs lives: roughly 40,000 Americans commit suicide every year, half of whom do so by shooting themselves. Handguns are the suicide method of choice in the United States—and the problem with that, of course, is that handguns are uniquely deadly. Handguns are America’s town gas. What would happen if the U.S. did what the British did, and somehow eradicated its leading cause of suicide? It’s not hard to imagine. It would uncouple the suicidal from their chosen method. And those few who were determined to try again would be forced to choose from far-less-deadly options, such as overdosing on pills, which is fifty-five times less likely to result in death than using a gun. A very conservative estimate is that banning handguns would save 10,000 lives a year, just from thwarted suicides. That’s a lot of people.”

“In one national survey, three quarters of Americans predicted that when a barrier is finally put up on the Golden Gate Bridge, most of those who wanted to take their life on the bridge would simply take their life some other way. But that’s absolutely wrong. Suicide is coupled.”

“We do not understand the importance of the context in which the stranger is operating.”

“Like most other people, my studies were about people. I said, maybe we ought to be more concerned with *places*.”

Crime in every city was concentrated in a tiny number of street segments. Like suicide, crime is tied to very specific places and contexts. And that means that when you confront the stranger, you have to ask yourself where and when you’re confronting the stranger—because those two things powerfully influence your interpretation of who the stranger is.

“Plath’s protagonist wasn’t looking to kill herself. She was looking for a way to kill herself. And not just any method would do. That’s the point of coupling: behaviors are specific. She needed to find a method that fit. And on that cold February night, the method that fit for Sylvia Plath happened to be right there in her kitchen.”

“Don’t look at the stranger and jump to conclusions. Look at the stranger’s world.”

## Chapter Eleven. Case Study: The Kansas City Experiments

“And what was the principal implication of coupling? That law enforcement didn’t need to be bigger; it needed to be more focused. If criminals operated overwhelmingly in a few concentrated hot spots, those crucial parts of the city should be more heavily policed than anywhere else, and the kinds of crime-fighting strategies used by police in those areas ought to be very different from those used in the vast stretches of the city with virtually no crime at all.”

## Chapter Twelve. Sandra Bland

“Human beings are not transparent. But when is this kind of thinking most dangerous? When the people we observe are mismatched: when they do not behave the way we expect them to behave.”

“hink back to the dramatic increase in traffic stops by the North Carolina State Highway Patrol. In seven years they went from 400,000 to 800,000. Now, is that because in that time period the motorists of North Carolina suddenly started running more red lights, drinking more heavily, and breaking the speed limit more often? Of course not. It’s because the state police changed tactics. They started doing far more haystack searches. They instructed their police officers to disregard their natural inclination to default to truth—and start imagining the worst: that young women coming from job interviews might be armed and dangerous, or young men cooling off after a pickup game might be pedophiles.”

“The death of Sandra Bland is what happens when a society does not know how to talk to strangers.”

“Because we do not know how to talk to strangers, what do we do when things go awry with strangers? We blame the stranger.”
