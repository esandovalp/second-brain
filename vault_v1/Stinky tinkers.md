As their name suggests, they're stinky, but they were also tinkerers well before they built their town. 
Their need to form a town came suddenly, as suddenly in one of their travels, they found a mountain that had lots of coal on the surface. Rag, the groups senior miner, had to, just had to stayed for a bit to get some of that coal out and about, and Poot the leader, agreed. 
As you would image, days turn to weeks, that turn into months, that turn into years, and so the stinky tinkers became a town.
