Atomic Notes are meant to be single ideas, or captures of thought -'atomic'' and 'autonomous' in the sense that they can be read and understood without needing to refer to anything more. They will have a Unique ID so that they can be connected to another atomic note card / idea in some way.
	This is where Obsidian is so good at. 
They are base on the [[Principle of Autonomy]]
